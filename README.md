Book API with Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, and Kubernetes



Technologies: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx



Developed a RESTful API to manage book data, utilizing modern tools and technologies for containerization, caching, and orchestration.



Key Features:

Flask-based API: Built a simple API to create, read, and list books.

PostgreSQL: Used PostgreSQL as the backend database to store book data.

Redis Caching: Integrated Redis to cache book data for faster retrieval, optimizing API performance.

Docker: Containerized the application with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

Nginx Reverse Proxy: Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle traffic and manage load balancing.

Kubernetes: Orchestrated the application using Kubernetes to manage containerized services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Flask API, and Nginx).




Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in API development with Flask and PostgreSQL.

Learned about caching strategies using Redis to optimize API response time.

Gained practical knowledge of containerization with Docker for isolating the application and database.

Implemented microservices orchestration using Kubernetes to deploy and manage application components.

Configured reverse proxy with Nginx for efficient traffic routing and handling.



Next Steps:

Integrate CI/CD pipelines 

Auto-scaling container orchestration with Kubernetes 

API monitoring & alerting
